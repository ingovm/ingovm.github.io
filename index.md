## Principal Security Software Architect - NXP Semiconductors Germany

I am a Principal Security Software Architect at NXP Semiconductors' Competence Center Crypto & Security.

Before joining NXP I was a research associate and a PhD candidate at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Sciences at Ruhr-Universität Bochum with Dr. Tim Güneysu and Dr. Christof Paar. My research focused on secure and efficient implementation of post-quantum cryptography on embedded systems (microcontrollers and FPGAs).
