## Principal Security Software Architect - NXP Semiconductors Germany

I am a Principal Security Software Architect in the Competence Center Crypto & Security at NXP Semiconductors.

Before joining NXP in 2015 I was a research assistant and a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Sciences at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum with Dr. Tim Güneysu and Dr. Christof Paar. My research focused on secure and efficient implementation of post-quantum cryptography on embedded systems (microcontrollers and FPGAs).
